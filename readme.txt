Domain Replace is a pretty simple but useful (powerful too) plugin for those people who moves their website from one domain to another domain and get trapped.

There are lots of backup plugin in the market that helps you to take a backup your site and restore into another site. But WordPress uses absolute URL instead of relative URL. So, the files inserted in content of your posts, pages and other custom post types, settings etc are still pointed to the old URL. 

Here comes "Domain Replace" to help you. It will change all instances of the OLD URL into NEW URL.

After installing the plugin you will see a new menu in "Settings > Domain Replace".
In first section, you need to provide old URL and new URL, then save.
After saving, in the same page, click on replace button and Ta-Da!
